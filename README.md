# AO Rounds

AO Rounds uses round-based statistics to allow cubers to gain a better idea of
how they perform in competition.
The original idea was proposed by Kian Mansour in the form of mo10ao5
(mean of 10 ao5s),
and in this project, I extend this idea to other event formats,
as well as allowing using average instead of mean
for the average calculation to avoid isuses caused by DNFs.

# Development notes

This app uses `create-react-app`'s template,
which means the standard scripts are used:

`npm start` will launch the application.

`npm test` will run tests, although I probably won't write any.

`npm run build` will build the application.
